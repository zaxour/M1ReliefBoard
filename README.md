# M1ReliefBoard
Small board to simplify soldering to Model 1 Genesis VDP RGB pins and reduce interference/jailbars.

Order the board in 1.6mm/0.062" thickness and it should fit cleanly under the RGB pins on the VDP. Use 30 AWG wire/enameled wire to connect, then use 28 AWG to go from the relief board to the 3BP.
